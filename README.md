### by Irene Sanz-Puente, Santiago Redondo-Salvo, Gloria Torres-Cort√©s, Mar√≠a de Toro, Susana Fernandes, Andreas B√∂rner, √ìscar Lorenzo, Fernando de la Cruz, and Marta Robledo.

Repository associated with the analysis used in Sanz-Puente et al., 2025, focus on the metabarcoding analysis of wheat bacterial endophytic community (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.06.628327). <i>This work is in review.</i> 
 

Files containing the metadata, ASV sequences table and taxonomy table data are provided here. Other data used in the analysis can be found in the Supplementary material of the paper or as data frame in scripts.

## üìÇ Repository structure
- `data/raw/`: raw sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files), sample metadata  
- `scripts/`: bioinformatics and statistical analysis  
  - `preprocess.sh` ‚Äì read quality control and trimming  
  - `taxonomy.R` ‚Äì taxonomic profiling with *phyloseq*, *vegan*  
  - `statistics.R` ‚Äì statistical tests and visualizations  
- `results/`: figures and tables generated from the analysis  
- `docs/`: notes and sample outputs

## üß™ Reproducing the analysis
### Running the pipeline
